    "Furthermore, the 95% confidence interval for the average annual salary is approximately between $88,802.56 and $89,321.03. This interval provides a range in which we are confident the true average annual salary lies. Given that this entire range is above the $75,000 threshold posited in our hypothesis, it confirms our earlier conclusion.\n"
